    "The task is to produce a neural process which is tailored to solve a physical system.  In this case, the physical system to be solved is the heat diffusion across a two-dimensional grid.  There are three main changes I wish to make to the standard neural process.  These are listed below, along with a brief description of their physical motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Convolutional Encoder and Decoder block \n",
    "Spatial equivariance is built into the system, since the heat diffusion function does not have a spatially dependent forcing term.  All terms are based on derivatives, which means the solution obeys spatial equivariance.  I hope to replicate this feature in the architecture, allowing for an easier learning process.\n",
    "#### 2. Learning using Privileged Information\n",
    "Learning using privileged information (LUPI) allows the model, while training, to have access to `privileged information' (PI).  PI could be anything important the model should be aware of.  For example, if the total energy in the grid is conserved, imput this as PI.  When it comes to test time, the model does not have access to any PI.  The hope is that the model can infer what the PI should be (e.g. by figuring out what the total energy is and conserving it), making for a faster learning process.  There is a wide variety of PI to be used and experimented with.  A few more examples are: initial conditions, final conditions, decay constant, entropy measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the PI is implemented is through an encoder which runs separately to the usual encoder.  The PI embedding is then aggregated with the embedding of the data using a residual neural network; we do not want the PI to dominate the learning, but merely to add a `first order correction' to the learning process.  The good thing about this structure is that the PI can be added to any encoder block (e.g. flat encoder or convolutional encoder)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Time-Order Respecting Aggregator\n",
    "In a neural process, the embeddings of the data at different times, $t_i$, are aggregated with a permutation invariant aggregator.  This is not usually useful for physical processes, as there tends to be a time-respecting process such as increase in entropy (in this case, diffusion of heat).  Therefore, it might be useful to reflect this in the aggregator.  The aggregator is such that there is no information leak from future to past - it imposes causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregator could also be designed to reflect temporal equivariance, for the same reasons as the spatial equivariance: the diffusion equation involves no terms which depend explicitly on time, but rather only the derivative with resepct to time.  If the model is temporally equivariant, it may perform much better on extrapolation tasks (as it is not completely `blind' when it heads out of the sample, having learnt temporal behaviour)\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible choice for this is to allow the model to `learn' these features by implementing a multi-head attention network.  However, with this option there is far less control over which physical concepts I am imposing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope these three changes will improve on the most basic vanilla neural process architecture to learn the heat diffusion behaviour over a two-dimensional grid, as they are all grounded in physical concepts. "
